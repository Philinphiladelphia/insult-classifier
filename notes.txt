After we extract facial features from each photo, i want to perform unsupervised clustering on all the features so that we'll have a larger pool of insults to draw from for each photo.
Alternatively, I just take the (n) insults with highest confidence?

presence of emojis (include emojis, because it would be hilarious)

Keep a queue-based cache of all comments read in the last 5 minutes. If user exhausts a cluster, then default to "Chortle my balls"

Run multiple different voice generators, and a device to switch between them?

Have a compliment mode, to praise someone with r/toastme?

To identify good insults:
make a CSV file with a bunch of good insults
extract fe


Dummy stretch goal: train on new dataset to add a different voice?
